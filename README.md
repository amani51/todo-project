## What is  the todo??
ToDo App is a kind of app that is generally used to maintain our day-to-day tasks or list everything that we have to do, with the most important tasks at the top of the list, and the least important tasks at the bottom. It is helpful in planning our daily schedules.



### TODO format
- TODO can have multiple columns.
- Each column has tasks that start with a checkbox sign `- [ ]` or just a hyphen `- `
- Completed column name must contain `✓` or `[x]`.
- There are "2 spaces" at the end of every task title to serve as line breaks.
- Tags, mentions, estimates, date time, ticket id, etc. can be entered at the end of the task title.
- A task with 2 space indentation in the title is a sub-task or description.
